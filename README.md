## Use Cases

Here are some common use cases for the ConvertkitV4 v4 API client.

First configure the ``convertkit_v4-ruby`` gem with your ``API_KEY`` and ``API_SECRET``, and initialize a new client. After that, you can fetch data from your account.

### List subscribers

List all subscribers added to your account on or after a specific date.

```ruby
response = client.subscribers(from: "2016-03-01")
# => <Faraday::Response ...>

response.status
# => 200
```

### Fetching subscriber data

Subscribers can be looked up by their ``subscriber_id``.

```ruby
response = client.subscriber("17682009")
# => <Faraday::Response ...>

response.status
# => 200
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, copy `.env.local.sample` to `.env.local` and substitute your own real values from your account. Finally, run `rake spec` to run the tests.

You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
